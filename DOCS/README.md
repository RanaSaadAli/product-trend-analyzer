# 📘 My Learning Folder — Concepts I Want to Remember & Share

Welcome to my **Learning Folder** — a personal space where I document and explain technical concepts I’ve learned while building real-world project.

This folder is designed to serve **three key goals**:

1. 🧠 **For Myself** — To revisit and quickly understand any concept I’ve already worked on, without having to search all over again.
2. 🤝 **For Others** — To provide clear, example-based explanations that help fellow learners.
3. 💼 **To showcase** how I learn, apply, and communicate technical ideas clearly through real work

## 🧩 What’s Inside?

This folder contains **separate Markdown files**, each focused on a specific concept I’ve learned. These are not just notes — they’re complete, explained guides written in my own words.

Each doc includes:
- ✅ What the concept is about
- ✅ Simple code examples
- ✅ Lessons I’ve learned

### 📂 Example Topics (so far):
- `git_workflow.md` — My Git & GitHub workflow   

> 🔄 This folder will grow as I continue learning and documenting new concepts.

## 🎯 Why I Created This

I realized that learning something once is not enough. If I don’t revisit or explain it, I forget.

So I created this folder to:
- Reinforce my understanding
- Save time in future projects
- Help others who learn like me
- Build a public record of my learning journey

## 👋 Who Should Check This Out?

- 🧠 My future self — when I want to recall something fast  
- 📘 Other learners — who want clean, real explanations  
- 💼 Anyone curious about how I approach problems, learn through projects, and explain what I’ve learned

## ✍️ About Me

I’m a self-driven learner who believes in **learning deeply**, **building practically**, and **sharing clearly**.  
This journal is my way of turning daily learning into a long-term asset — for myself and for others.

If you're reading this and you're on your own learning journey — I hope you find something helpful here.
