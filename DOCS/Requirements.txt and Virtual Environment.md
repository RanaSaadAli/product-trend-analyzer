# Requirements.txt

 ✅ What is `requirements.txt`?

  The `requirements.txt` file is a simple text file that **lists all the Python packages** your project needs to work.  

It also includes the **exact versions** of each package.

---

## 🤔 Why Do We Use It?

When you create a Python project, you usually install some packages (like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.).  

If someone else wants to run your project, they **must have the same packages** installed — otherwise, it may not work or crash.

The `requirements.txt` file solves this problem by telling Python:

> “These are the packages my project depends on. Please install them.”

---

## 🛠️ How to Create `requirements.txt`

We create this file using the following command:

```bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt

```

### 📌 Breakdown of the command:

  

| Part                 | Meaning                                                                 |

|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| `pip`               | A tool used to install and manage Python packages                       |

| `freeze`            | Lists all installed packages in the current environment                 |

| `>`                 | A command-line operator to send output into a file                      |

| `requirements.txt`  | The name of the file that will store the list of packages               |

This means:  

> "List all installed packages and save them to `requirements.txt`."

---
## 📥 How to Use `requirements.txt` to Install Packages

If someone downloads your project, they can install all required packages using:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

This tells Python:

> "Read the list from `requirements.txt` and install **all** the mentioned packages."

## 🧪 What Is a Virtual Environment?

A **virtual environment** is like a **separate space** for your project.  
It keeps all the packages you install **isolated** from your system Python.
### 🔒 Benefits:

- Each project can use its **own versions** of libraries  

- Your system Python stays **clean and stable**  

- No conflict between projects using **different versions** of the same package  

---
## 🎯 Why Virtual Environments Are Important

Let’s say:

- Project A needs `pandas==1.5.0`  

- Project B needs `pandas==2.0.1`  

If you install both globally, Python may crash or behave incorrectly.

Using a virtual environment allows you to install only what your project needs, without affecting others.

---

## 📝 Steps to Follow in a Project

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

```bash

python -m venv venv

```

2. **Activate it:**

- On **Windows**:

```bash

venv\Scripts\activate

```

- On **macOS/Linux**:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate

```

3. **Install packages:**

```bash

pip install pandas matplotlib

```

4. **Create `requirements.txt`:**

```bash

pip freeze > requirements.txt

```

5. *(Optional)* Review and remove any unnecessary packages manually from the file

---
## 💡 What Happens If You Don't Use Virtual Environment?

- Packages get installed **globally**  

- Your system Python becomes **messy and unstable**  

- You may break other projects by changing versions  

- People using your code won’t know which packages (and versions) are needed  
 
---

## ❌ Should You Push the `venv` Folder to GitHub?

**No. Never push your `venv` folder to GitHub.**  

Instead:

- Add `venv/` to your `.gitignore` file  

- Push only the `requirements.txt` file  

This keeps your repository **clean and professional**.

## 🧠 Summary of Today’s Lesson

- `requirements.txt` lists all the packages your project depends on  

- You create it using: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`  

- Others install packages using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  

- A virtual environment keeps your dependencies **separate**  

- It prevents version conflicts and keeps your system Python **safe**  

- Always avoid pushing your `venv` folder — use `requirements.txt` instead
